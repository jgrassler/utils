# Assorted Utilities

This repository contains assorted standalone utilities you may or may not find
useful. It is strictly a dumping ground for things I consider too small and/or
single-purpose to warrant a repository of their own. Hence I will probably
ignore pull requests and issues on it. That being said, if you really like
something in here and/or want to build on it feel free to drop me a line about
it. I'm open to moving things that turn out to be actually useful to a
repository of their own where they will get a bit more love than in this place.
